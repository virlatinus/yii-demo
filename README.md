## Yii 2 Demo project using the Advanced Project Template


The main difference in this project is that we're using docker-compose.yml version 3.7 
which uses an existing mysql container in an external network (to reduce the number of running images).

Additionally, this project uses the `yiisoftware/yii2-php:8.3-fpm-nginx` Docker image.
